This Python Jupyter notebook explores investment portfolios that have decent return
(approximately 8 percent on average over the last ten years) and lower risk than the
overall stock market.
</p>
<p>
If you are fortunate to have some cash available for investment you have to decide
how to invest this cash (not making an explicit investment
decision is a decision).
</p>
<p>
The US stock market, over the long term, has yielded good returns. Unfortunately it is an
inescapable fact that risk and return are related.  The returns provided by the stock
market come with the risk of losses in your investment portfolio, at least in the short to
medium term.  At the time this notebook was written (November 2021) the stock market
had dramatic returns after a COVID-19 inspired market crash.  In such a time it is
important to remember that there have been many periods where "the market" has had
substantial downturns and low returns.
</p>
<p>
As any good financial adviser will tell you, your investment strategy should depend
on your stage in life. Is retirement decades away, close or are you retired?
</p>
<p>
If your retirement is decades away, one of the simplest ways to achieve good investment
returns is "dollar cost averaging" where you invest a certain amount every month
in one or more low fee market index funds or ETFs.
</p>
<p>
When there is a market
downturn your share purchase cost will be lower resulting in gains when the market recovers.
Many people take advantage of dollar cost averaging by allocating a fraction of their
salary for investment in their employer's 401K retirement plan.
</p>
<p>
If you are at or near retirement age then the inevitable market downturns are much
less acceptable since you will not be able to take advantage of market cycles
that could last for years.
</p>
<p>
This notebook explores conservative investment portfolios that have lower risk and lower
correlation with the stock market (a.k.a., lower market beta). These are portfolios that
may be appropriate for people who are retired or near retirement.
</p>
<p>
The portfolio that originally inspired this notebook is based on
the Bridgewater Associates "All Weather" portfolio proposed by Bridgewater
founder Ray Dalio. This portfolio is discussed in a Bridgewater promotional white paper
<a href="https://www.bridgewater.com/research-and-insights/the-all-weather-story">The All Weather Story</a>
From the white paper:
</p>
<blockquote>
 What the average person needs is a good, reliable asset allocation they can hold for the long-run.
 Bridgewaterâ€™s answer is All Weather, the result of three decades of learning how to invest in the
 face of uncertainty.
</blockquote>
<p>
The results in this notebook show that, in the last ten years (from 2021) the
performance a portfolio that is similar to the Bridgewater "all weather" portfolio
is no better than a simple 40 percent stock, 60 percent bond portfolio that is often
recommended for those at or near retirement.  This notebook shows a portfolio consisting
of just two ETFs VTI (40%) and SCHP (60%) has less volatility than the "all weather" portfolio
with returns that are only slightly lower.
</p>
<p>
The 40% market/60% bond mix is difficult to beat when it comes to risk and return.
A number of dividend assets are examined in this notebook in an attempt to find
a portfolio with higher return at a similar risk level. This search was not successful.
