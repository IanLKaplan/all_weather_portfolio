    "close price is the market price for the asset adjusted for dividend distributions.  In this\n",
    "view, a dividend yielding asset that goes down in market price would not be desirable.\n",

    "the dividend is very reliable and has never been missed (in \"real life\" dividends can\n",
    "be missed or reduced).  If the market price of X goes down to 50 dollars, we don't care\n",
    "because we are still receiving the 10 dollar yearly dividend and we are not planning\n",
