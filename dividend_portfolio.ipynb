    "This notebook discusses investment portfolios composed of dividend yielding assets. This notebook\n",
    "was written after the All Weather Portfolio notebook. The dividend portfolio\n",
    "described here is seen as having lower market risk (because of the focus on dividends)\n",
    "and lower interest rate risk.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "To reduce investment risk portfolios often allocate a significant portion (50-60 percent) of the\n",
    "portfolio to bonds or bond funds. Although these portfolios are viewed as low risk portfolios,\n",
    "they can have significant interest rate risk resulting in losses in the bond assets.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "The portfolios investigated in the All Weather Portfolio notebook return, on average,\n",
    "about eight percent. These returns are highly volatile from year to year however.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "An alternative to the classic 40/60 stock/bond portfolio is a portfolio of dividend assets.\n",
    "A diversified portfolio that returns approximately 8% from dividends should have\n",
    "lower volatility, compared to a 40/60 stock/bond portfolio.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "One way to look at portfolio return is via \"adjusted close price\".  The adjusted\n",
    "close price is the market price for the asset adjusted for dividend distributions.\n",
    "In this view, a dividend yielding asset with an adjusted close price that goes\n",
    "down in market price would not be desirable.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Another way to look at a dividend portfolio is only through dividend yield.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Consider the case where there is an asset, stock X, that sells for 100 dollars a\n",
    "share with a yearly dividend yield of 10 dollars.  In this example, we will assume that\n",
    "the dividend is reliable and has never been missed (in \"real life\" dividend payments\n",
    "can be missed or reduced).  If the market price of X goes down to 50 dollars,\n",
    "we don't care because we are still receiving the 10 dollar yearly dividend and\n",
    "we are not planning on selling X.\n",

    "After a market downturn, like the 2008 credit crisis, a recovery and increase in stock\n",
    "share prices might be expected. At the same time, \"quantitative easing\" in the United States,\n",
    "Europe and Japan resulted in interest rates near zero, making many fixed income investments\n",
    "unattractive. This resulted in a huge investment flow into stock market.\n",

    "The P/E ratio is a classic measure of any security's value, indicating how many years of\n",
    "profits (at the current rate) it takes to recoup an investment in the stock. The\n",
    "current S&P500 10-year P/E Ratio is 37.5. This is 89% above the modern-era market\n",
    "average of 19.6, putting the current P/E 2.3 standard deviations above the modern-era\n",
    "average. This suggests that the market is Strongly Overvalued.\n",
